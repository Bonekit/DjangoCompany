<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
[![product-screenshot]]()

Django.Company is not my first Django application, but the first I like to release on GitHub. I had a lot of fun and learned many new things about Django, for this application I tried to use the class-based-views and currently Iâ€™m not a friend of this kind of views. I find that the function-based-views are a lot easier to customize and to use.

With my application you can use the following features:
* User-Defaults (login, registration, logout)
* Messages (JavaScript included)
* CRUD: Companies
* Upload images (Logos)
* Company-ListView with Pagination
